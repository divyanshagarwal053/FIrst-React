# First-React
Created with CodeSandbox

It's a Basic Website which is my first experiment on react.

Components:
1. Header
2. Footer
3. Carousel
4. Cards(Body)
5. Navbar


Note: In this I tried to incliude home, services, product, signUp pages but it shows any unknown error So if anyone able to solve that then fork back.
